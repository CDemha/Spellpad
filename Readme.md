Spellpad is a free word processing tool which includes a built in spellchecker (using the WPF RichTextBox control) and other special features and enhancements which make it better than the default Notepad program but under Microsoft Word. It is well designed and straightforward and comes with a simplistic user interface which makes it easy to use.

### Releases
Currently Spellpad is only support on Windows. You can [view the releases here.](https://github.com/CDemha/Spellpad/releases)

### Authors and Contributors
As of now there aren't many of us developing and testing the program. It's just me developing and doing testing and c6 purley testing. This started out as a small personal project but it quickly grew to something more. We hope to grow and develop this project for a much faster final release.
