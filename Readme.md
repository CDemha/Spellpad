Spellpad is a free word processing tool which includes a built in spellchecker (using the WPF RichTextBox control) and other special features and enhancements. Spellpad is meant to be a fun personal project.

### Authors and Contributors
As of now there aren't many of us developing and testing the program. It's just me developing and doing testing and c627627 purley testing. This started out as a small personal project but it quickly grew to something more. We hope to grow and develop this project for a much faster final release.
